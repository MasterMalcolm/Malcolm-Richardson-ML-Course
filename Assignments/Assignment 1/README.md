This was a simple introduction to Google Colab and linking a notebook to 
a GitHub repository.

I learned how to take notes in a markdown cell and execute a code cell. I also 
learned about Kaggle and loaded some sample datasets to this repository. 

The main challenge was getting the Colab notebook synced to the repository.
