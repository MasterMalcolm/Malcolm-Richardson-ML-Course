This midterm lab is an extension of exploratory analysis and goes into
telling a story with the data. For continuity, I used the Titanic shipwreck
dataset again.

I learned how to quantify the impact of different factors on an outcome. I used 
the confusion matrix to tell a story about why certain passengers survived or
perished. 

The challenge was going beyond the initial analysis to interpret the data in
such a way that the story of an individual passenger could be told.
