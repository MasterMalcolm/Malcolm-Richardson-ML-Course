In this course recap lab, we trained a model to predict the fates of passengers from 
the Titanic shipwreck.

I learned about exploratory data analysis and how to apply feature sets to train an AI model. 

There was a challenge in deciding which method would be best for dropping missing values. 
Another challenge was making sure the model trained on the proper amount of data to avoid
underfitting and overfitting.
