Russia's development in cancer research could have benefitted from machine learning thanks to the data of past research. 
A model could be trained on this data and provide a clear map of knowledge gaps that research experts could focus on. The 
model was likely trained using protein structures of different cancer cells so medical researchers could make comparisons 
with ease. 

The data collection process was facilitated by the Russian government and its immediate access to medical records. The 
ability to access data quickly is an advantage over other countries like the United States, where personal health information 
is decentralized and tends to be encrypted.
