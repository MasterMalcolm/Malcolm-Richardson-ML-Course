Exploratory Data Analysis in this code presents a process.

First we have Univariate Analysis, where only the top ten companies by percentage of devices are considered. 
The rest are grouped into “other” and dropped. The remaining devices are grouped by type of device and operating system. 
Then Mac and macOS are grouped into the same category. Android OS is dropped because few devices use it. The code looks 
for how much flash storage is on each device and categorizes them by amount of flash storage. Since 94.5% of devices have 
no flash storage, we drop this column. In the Bivariate Analysis, the code shows correlations between the company and the 
device(s) they specialize in, OS most in use, CPU & GPU types mostly used. The next Bivariate Analysis shows that most 
companies make mostly notebooks, most device types use Windows OS, most device types use the Intel CPU, and gaming/workstation 
devices use the Nvidia GPU. Finally multivariate analysis is best shown in a heatmap and this particular code drops correlations 
over 0.8.
